# protein_VAE
I built here a Variational Auto Encoder to analyze data from molecular dynamics simulations. 
The data was generated using a native topology based coarse-grained model, where each amino acid is represented by a single bead in the position of the C-alpha atom.

Files include: 
1. model.py - an encoder-decoder architechture, without variation.
2. vae.py - same as model, but with variation.
3. Folding_VAE.ipynb - project notebook

In the project notebook, the trajectory data is loaded using internal coordinates, in the form of a distance matrix, describing the distance between every pair of beads i and j in the protein.
Simulations run for the SH3 protein (PDB ID 1srl)
